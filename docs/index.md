# Lorem Ipsum Dolor sit Amet.

## Welcome to My Coding Notes

Over time in my programming career. I stumbled upon a problem, then looking into intricate details to solve that specific code. Then after few months, looking back into my code, I'm forgotten why it's there in the first place.

This is the website to fix this, to fix me. And anybody wants to read my mind when I code something, or figuring out if my code gone wrong in the future.

Works over here definitely has some imprints publicly, either it's in my GitHub or somewhere else. As I often work and hack in open source code more often. I wrote here exactly as how my mind speaking to me, so sorry if the language is a bit silly.
